I made 31 small flash games before making IdleOn™, and while most failed terribly, I learned from the failures to make an MMO that brings something new and exciting to the table!\r\n- With an active discord of over 100,000 users, I place a huge importance on player feedback. Weekly polls and custom suggestions drive the direction of the game, so you can rest assured this game will always be for gamers, made by a gamer!","strSnippet":"The MMO you play while playing other games! Create multiple characters who are always working, even when you're offline! The game gets more complex the more you play, and with features like Tower Defence, Pet Battles, Cooking and more, there's never a dull moment in IdleOn™"}}]]
