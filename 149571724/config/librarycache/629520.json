If you want to watch a DRM protected DVD and run Soundpad at the same time, one of both will not work. You can toggle DRM validation in the options, when you are about to watch or listen to DRM protected media.\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[i]Check out the demo and start collecting your individual sounds![/i]","strSnippet":"Play sounds in voice chats in high digital quality.
